# SIEM-Setup-Sysmon-ELK üöÄ

This repository showcases my efforts in setting up a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution using **Sysmon** and the **ELK Stack** on Kali Linux to monitor and analyze Windows system events.

## üõ† What I Accomplished
1. Configured **Sysmon** for advanced event logging (e.g., file creation, process creation).
2. Integrated **Winlogbeat** to ship Windows logs into the SIEM pipeline.
3. Set up **Logstash** for event processing and filtering.
4. Stored logs in **Elasticsearch** for indexing and querying.
5. Visualized system logs in **Kibana**, transforming the ELK Stack into a basic SIEM solution.

## üîç Why This Matters
This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly approach to creating a **SIEM solution** using open-source tools:
- Detect potential threats by analyzing logs.
- Monitor Windows activities in real-time.
- Gain hands-on experience with log ingestion, processing, and visualization.
